Dynamic Label Height with Autolayout
===========

This project shows how to have labels that grow vertically
depending on their content while also allowing for the benefits
of autolayout.

I chose to showcase this inside table view cells, and to construct
these in their own xib file. This is simply a personal preference
and not required for this to work.
